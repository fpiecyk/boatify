### Botify is a management system for sailing yacht and motorboat rentals.
It was created to help manage my friend's company.
The system is dedicated to both the customer and rental manager interface.

### Client interface:

### Manager interface:
• Adding boats to the rental offer, divided into sailboats and motorboats
• Adding marinas where you can pick up your boat (marina addresses)
• Acceptance of boat reservations
• Summary of all customer reservations
• Summary of revenues generated by individual customers/boats
• Export of reservation data to a csv file
• Automatically sending an e-mail with reservation details to the manager
